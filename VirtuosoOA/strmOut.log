WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file '/home/rerra/sky130_cds/pnr/mult_seq.gds' already exists. It will be overwritten.
INFO (XSTRM-288): Performing automatic layer mapping because either the layer mapping information is not provided or the XST_AUTO_LM  value is used with the '-layerMap' option. Additionally, the  'xStrmOut_layerMap.txt' file has been generated and the mapping information has been added to it.
WARNING (XSTRM-202): The '-topCell' option is used without any view name. During XStream Out, the translator will translate all the views of maskLayout type for each of the specified topCell(s). Specify the view name that needs to be translated.
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the '-viaMap' option for preserving oaVia instances in a XStream Out - XStream In round trip. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.
