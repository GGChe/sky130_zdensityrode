#                          Technology and LEF layer map
# Design "mult_seq"
#
# Technology and LEF layers are mapped automatically by innovus.
# If a user needs customised mapping, specify a layermap file. Layermap file
# is specified using command "setExtractRCMode -lefTechFileMap <layermapFile>".
#

# Mapping of layers are from <lefLayer> to <techLayer>
